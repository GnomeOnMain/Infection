# Infection
The very first and most simple version of an "Infection" simulator.
100 sprites are created and move around the screen, with one of them being red and the rest green.
when the red sprite collides with a green sprite it "infects" the green sprite, turning it red.
red particles will "chase" after the green particles and infect them after collision

eventual additions
- more particle types, such as those which attempt to "kill" infected particles
- different particle behaviors, such as green particles fleeing "infected" particles
- varied terrain, allowing for more varied particle behaviors and interactions
- methods of user interaction, such as spawning in infected particles, pausing the simulation, resetting the simulation, setting condtions, maps, etc.
